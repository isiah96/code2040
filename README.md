# Code2040 API Challenge

## Introduction
My name is Isiah Manns, and I am a sophomore, computer science major at The Univesity of Maryland: College Park. I learned about the Code2040 Fellows Program through the Black Engineering Society (BES) on campus. I couldn't be any more excited to go through the process of applying for this program, and I wish good luck to all of the applicants! I can't wait to see what the future has in store for the program come Summer 2017!

## My Code
Each of the files: step1.py, step2.py, step3.py, step4.py and step5.py contain python scripts for their respective tasks, and are commented to show some of the useful features of the language that I came across when doing some research in order to figure out how to complete the challenges. Some of the key features I definitely learned included making HTTP POST requests, extended slices, decoding JSON strings, and manipulating datetime objects.

Enjoy!
